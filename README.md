My Solutions to the Bioinformatics Stronghold problems on the Rosalind project.
Written in Python. Certain problems can contain multiple solutions. Code doesn't contain data files,
however, sample data and sample output is present for testing.
Problems can be found here: http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/

If you have sordid intentions of copying this code for solutions to Rosalind then let
the wrath of Gods of Olympia be upon you. Otherwise, be welcomed to have a look around at
these alternative solutions =).
